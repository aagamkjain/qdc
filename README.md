Demonstrate your ability to provision, configure, and deploy a static website by hosting it exclusively on a cloud Virtual Machine (VM) instance. This exercise evaluates your technical depth, problem-solving skills, and ability to take end-to-end ownership of a deployment scenario.


This repository contains:
- Static website (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- Nginx configuration for deployment  
- Documentation of the entire process

## 2. Web Server Installation (Nginx)

SSH into the VM:
```bash
ssh -i "my-key.pem" ubuntu@<PUBLIC_IP>
```

to update packages - 
``` bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
to update - sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

to install nginx - sudo apt install nginx -y

and i have also edited soeme inbound rules to http because running it on http protocol - http://3.27.14.181/


also to check your status first allow nginx full and enable and ceck status

sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

try to create the folders and files and this manner altough can be changed from the config file =
```file struct
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/temperature-app
sudo chown -R /var/www/temperature-app
```

for nginx config files - 
``` sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/temperature-app
```

nginx config - 
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;

    root /var/www/temperature-app;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```
ennable the config and disable defualt becuase by default nginx loads the premade nginx html page 
```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/temperature-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

for testing and reloading 
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx


now you can just open the website as instance is running the url is http://3.27.14.181/
